# Heart-Disease-Olympics-Black-Friday-Insights

## Overview
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of three diverse datasets: Heart Disease, Olympics, and Black Friday Sales. The aim is to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and visualize data using Python's data analysis libraries.

## Datasets Analyzed
1. **Heart Disease Dataset**: Focuses on identifying key factors contributing to heart disease.
2. **Olympics Dataset**: Provides an analysis of historical Olympics data to uncover trends in performance, participation, and medals.
3. **Black Friday Sales Dataset**: Analyzes consumer behavior during Black Friday sales, with insights into purchasing patterns and demographics.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations and array manipulations.

## Key Features
- **Heart Disease Analysis**: Explores correlations between various health metrics and the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Olympics Data Analysis**: Uncovers patterns in athlete performance, country participation, and medal trends over the years.
- **Black Friday Sales Insights**: Delivers insights into consumer demographics, purchasing trends, and product preferences.
